# Sensor_PPG_MAX30102 | Heart Rate Sensor

[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/paypal-donate-yellow.svg)](https://paypal.me/mictsai?locale.x=zh_TW)

Arduino based sensor learning project. The feature combines the heart rate calculation and real-time update, plotting the PPG curve on display.

 - Bias Cancellation | Store raw data in time, when new data coming that bias level will calculate as average.

 - Heart Rate Detect | Setting upper/lower threshold once your PPG light reflection value cross u/l threshold, condition expressions will output the BPM results.

```
Arduino tool kit, and require the following material:
- MCU: ESP8266 
- Display: SD1306_128x64_OLED
- PPG Sensor: MAX30102
```
